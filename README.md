Support Vector Machine Model on Iris Dataset-
As part of my udemy course,data science and machine learning bootcamp,this project was a to-do project to implement a SVM model on a 
Iris Dataset.I made use of GridSearchCV for fine tuning of hyperparameters of the estimator.Grid-searching is the process of scanning the data to configure optimal parameters for a given model.The goal of the SVM algorithm is to create the best line or decision boundary that can segregate n-dimensional space into classes so that we can easily put the new data point in the correct category in the future. This best decision boundary is called a hyperplane.
