## Support Vector Machine Model on Iris Dataset
* As part of my udemy course,<b>"Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp"</b>, this project implements a SVM model.
*  The Iris flower dataset has been used.
*  EDA has been performed on the dataset.
*  Using scikit-learn library, the SVM model has been trained on the dataset.
*  Model Evaluation is performed to analyse the classification report and confusion matrix of the model.
* GridSearchCV has been used for fine tuning of hyperparameters of the estimator.
